// Refactoring an element is a bit more tricky
// First, React decides if a tag is an element by checking its case
// lower case means element
// upper case means component

var element = <div/>
// becomes
element = React.createElement("div", null)

try {

var component = <Div/>
// becomes
component = React.createElement(Div, null)

} catch(e) {}

// Second, React converts all events, these elements trigger, to
// synthetic events. This is often not a problem, they are simply events.
// But you can't trigger your own.
// So even if your <Input> component accepts a onClick callback as property
// You can't call it with the same event as an <input> element would


// One approach could be this.
// We simply implement our own onChange caller
// Here we create a number input that only calls onChange on number inputs
// (non-numbers trigger an empty change)
var NumberInput = React.createClass({

  getInitialState: function() {
    return {value: ''}
  },

  handleInput: function(e) {

    // we could try to modify the event to get or data in
    // but this could mess things up
    // instead we prevent this event from further actions
    e.preventDefault()

    var newNumber = e.target.value

    // filter empty-changes
    if (newNumber.length < 1 || newNumber === this.state.value) return

    this.setState({value: newNumber})

    //then we extract our data and give it to onChange
    this.props.onChange(newNumber)

  },

  render: function () {

    return <input type='number' value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleInput}/>

  },

})

function logChange(v){
  console.log(v)
}


// Here we see, that the new NumberInput has a different interface
// it's onChange property implies that events will be received, but this isn't
// the case. Also, even if we would want to call it like the original input,
// we would need to use upper case, and wouldn't win anything
var reactElement = <div style={{width: 300, margin: 'auto'}}>

  <h2>Logging number inputs</h2>

  <h2>Before Refactor</h2>
  <input type='number' onChange={function(e) { logChange(e.target.value) }}/>

  <h2>After Refactor</h2>
  <NumberInput onChange={logChange}/>

</div>

ReactDOM.render(reactElement, document.getElementById('app'))

// Other approaches include not using "default" prop names in the first place
// onUpdate instead of onChange
// It could also that a component uses onMouseDown to do something internall
// and triggers a onChange, which could cause confusion
// Often components deliver richer interactions than elements in the first place
// so their prop methods can reflect that with the name
